\emph{Helicopters in motion have complex and intricate components. Damage can occur at any time to any part of the helicopter. One such damage that occurs in helicopters is ground resonance where the regressive mode merges with the motion mode of the helicopter frame (fuselage). In this study, three stages of work were carried out to identify the phenomenon of ground resonance in helicopters. Namely through measurement, calculation and simulation modeling on Femap which has been validated in this final project. There is no potential for ground resonance in the AS 565 MBe Panther helicopter modification through ground test data with a damping ratio quantification of 0.0542, 0.0479, 0.0433, and 0. 0505 each at the rate of roll, rate of pitch, rate of yaw and acceleration in the y-axis direction, has also been analyzed regarding the response of the oscillation cycle limit at $f_1$ of 0$\%$, $f_2$ of 15.88$\%$, $f_3$ of 4.27$\%$ and $f_4$ of 0.62$\%$. as well as the frequency response of the modified AS 565 MBe Panther Helicopter to ground tests and mathematical calculations. In the modification results obtained as much as 2$\%$ of the helicopter frequency response, so it is found that there will be an additional potential of 2$\%$ from the modification results on the helicopter. Then in the last section, simulation modeling was found using the finite element method in Femap software with a frequency correlated to the ground resonance phenomenon, namely at a frequency of 4.31 Hz (6th mode) with a response of 3$\%$.}
