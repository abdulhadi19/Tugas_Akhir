abstract = {Ground Resonance (GR) in helicopters is a potentially dynamic instability commonly involving the coalescence of the blade lag mode with the fuselage motion. Linear techniques can be employed to identify the unstable rotor speeds with acceptable level of accuracy for some problems. However, structural nonlinearities can induce limit cycle oscillations (LCOs) that can define new GR boundaries and limit the helicopter operational landing envelope. Although there are different strategies to control design, stabilize a GR including nonlinearities is still a relevant challenge. In this context, this article presents a novel approach to suppress LCO during GR including structural nonlinearities. Two different cases of nonlinearities on the landing gear are considered. The first one includes a quadratic damping typically related to the hydraulic shock absorbers, and the second case considers the addition of a hardening stiffness combined with dry-friction. The proposed approach is based on the Fuzzy Takagi-Sugeno modeling and a polytopic representation of the system with these nonlinear terms is developed. It is used a Lyapunov's stability function and Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) to solve a convex optimization problem for finding a controller gain to suppress the LCOs in a range of rotor speeds where they take place. Numerical simulations are carried out to demonstrate the approach and it is shown that an unique control gain can asymptotically stabilize the system responses to assure a safe landing envelope.}

abstract = {This paper is focused on an assessment of the state-of-the-art of operational modal analysis (OMA) methodologies in estimating modal parameters from output responses on helicopter structures. For this purpose, a ground vibration test was performed on a real helicopter airframe. In the following stages, several OMA techniques were applied to the measured data and compared with the results from typical input–output approach. The results presented are part of a more general research activity carried out in the Group of Aeronautical Research and Technology in Europe (GARTEUR) Action Group 19, helicopter technical activity, whose overall objective is the improvement of the structural dynamic finite element models using in-flight test data. The structure considered is a medium-size helicopter, a time-expired Lynx Mk7 (XZ649) airframe. In order to have a comprehensive analysis, the behaviour of both frequency- and time-domain-based OMA techniques are considered for the modal parameter estimates. An accuracy index and the reliability of the OMA methods with respect to the standard EMA procedures, together with the evaluation of the influence of the experimental setup on the estimate of the modal parameters, will be presented in the paper.}

abstract = {Helicopter Ground Resonance is a dynamic instability involving the coupling of the blades motion in the rotational plane (i.e. the lag motion) and the motion of the fuselage. This paper presents a study of the capacity of a Non-linear Energy Sink to control a Helicopter Ground Resonance. A model of helicopter with a minimum number of degrees of freedom that can reproduce Helicopter Ground Resonance instability is obtained using successively Coleman transformation and binormal transformation. A theoretical/numerical analysis of the steady-state responses of this model when a Non-linear Energy Sink is attached on the fuselage in an ungrounded configuration is performed. The analytic approach is based on complexification-averaging method together with geometric singular perturbation theory. Four steady-state responses are highlighted and explained analytically: complete suppression, partial suppression through strongly modulated response, partial suppression through periodic response and no suppression of the Helicopter Ground Resonance. A systematic method based on simple analytical criterions is proposed to predict the steady-state response regimes. The method is finally validated numerically.}
